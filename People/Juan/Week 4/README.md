# Banking Assignment

Based on problems 3 and 4 in the book (chapter 6: OOP)

## Part 1
Make a class that processes transactions:
* adding money to your account
* removing money
* converting your funds from one currency to another (bonus points for neat currency options)).

Itâ€™s recommended that your class takes in an :
* amount
* date
* currency (specifying a default)
* a conversion rate (default 1)
* a description (default None).

## Part 2
Make a class that stores account info :
* account number
* name
* a list of transactions

The prompt asks you to be able to save and load data from a file. We can get so extra as to have it :
* output your account balance in all sorts of fun ways
* allow the user to transfer money from one account to another
* calculate returns from dividends.  

As extra as you want.
