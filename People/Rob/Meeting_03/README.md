## PyCalendar

Build a functioning terminal/command line calendar that:
- Indicates the current day, month, year
- Displays the days of the month
- Allows the user to scroll through months and years
- Allows the user to make, read and modify events on days of their choosing
- Is nice to the user! (decent UX)
