# Object-Oriented Programming

The part for next Tuesday involves you making a class that processes transactions (adding money to your account, removing money, and converting your funds from one currency to another (bonus points for neat currency options)).
Itâ€™s recommended that your class takes in an amount, date, currency (specifying a default), a conversion rate (default 1), and a description (default None).

The second problem is a class that stores account info (account number, name, and a list of transactions).
The prompt asks you to be able to save and load data from a file.
We can get so extra as to have it output your account balance in all sorts of fun ways, allow the user to transfer money from one account to another, calculate returns from dividends. As extra as you want.
